Travel websites are becoming increasingly popular. People tend to use travel
planning online and visit different websites during the cycles of organization and boking.
There are two forms of tourism strategies. One is DMC and the other is bundles. It means
that the tourist provides information and demands according to user needs with the sum
of budget user. Packages are the one that gave instructions from the organization with its
own guide and how much it takes to go. The three of them benefit from both directions in
this process, but tourist guide does not have the means to engage in this process on their
own.
